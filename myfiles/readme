HOW TO USE THIS GUI

This is a very simple GUI for browsing files. To use, simply navigate around as you would in any other file browser.

To create folders and files, click the dedicated buttons in the top left of the window. Additional actions such as copying, renaming, deleting, and editing can be accessed contextually by right-clicking on files/folders.

Directories can be added to your "favorites" for quick navigation.
