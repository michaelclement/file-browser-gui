HOW TO USE THIS GUI

This is a very simple GUI for browsing files. To use, simply launch and then navigate around as you would in any other file browser.

To create folders and files click the dedicated buttons in the top left of the window. Additional actions such as copying, renaming, deleting, and editing can be accessed contextually by right-clicking on files/folders.

Try creating some nested folders and adding them to your "favorites".
